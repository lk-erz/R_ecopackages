# R_ecopackages
Simple scripts to test some ecological/environmental R packages

## ecochange
Measuring landscape changes in space and time: [documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ecochange/index.html)

## geodata
Geographical data download worldwide: [documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geodata/index.html)

## fuzzySim
Calculating fuzzy similarity in species distributions. It can also produce the underlying fuzzy distribution data, 
e.g. through interpolating or modelling species presence-absence data.

NOTE: This package works with species occurrence data in presence-absence tables. 
If your data are point occurrences and raster maps, check out [this blog post](https://modtools.wordpress.com/2020/02/11/fuzzysim-updated-to-3-0-on-cran/) on how to convert them into tabular presence-absence data.
